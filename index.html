  <h2 class="Heading">About</h2>
    <p>
      <strong> This website is a work in progress as I learn more about coding. Please bare with me through that time. </strong> <br>
      The code for this site is available on my github (linked further down) so don't worry I won't steal data or anything (I don't even know how to.) <br>
      <br>
      Hi, my name is Sage. My pronouns are She/Her and I'm a creative mind that is all over the place. I make videos on my YouTube channel, mainly about games I play however it'll be the place I also upload things like Animations and Game announcements and the like. <br>
      I also occasionally stream on Twitch or YouTube, and upload the Twitch VODS to my VODS channel. I mainly also stream games, however I'm open to streaming outside of that too. <br>
      I upload music I make to my music channel, I'm for the most part experimenting with a ton of different styles in the hopes to get better and create music with more meaning. <br>
      Outside of all the aforementioned, I also enjoy doing gamedev, which I hope to turn into a career someday. <br> <br>
      Thanks for reading! :D
